<!--
<p> The Steinmetz Lab at the University of Washington in Seattle is seeking applications for a position as a post-doctoral scientist. The scientist will work on data analysis and modeling in order to advance our large-scale electrophysiology technologies and our understanding of distributed computation across the brain. The primary focus of the position is the ‘Neuropixels Ultra’ project, in which we are developing novel electrophysiological technologies in collaboration with colleagues at the Allen Institute for Brain Science and with Johns Hopkins University. In addition to work on that specific project, the scientist will have access to cutting-edge large-scale datasets that combine behavior, electrophysiology, imaging, and optogenetics, and will have the ability to work creatively on questions of their own choosing, including helping to guide novel experimental data collection as necessary. The position is funded for 3 years by an NIH BRAIN Initiative grant, and is eligible to start immediately. It is expected that the scientist will eventually be based in Seattle, but a remote start is negotiable considering health concerns related to the ongoing global pandemic.

<p>The successful candidate is expected to have a Ph.D. in neuroscience or in relevant quantitative fields such as physics, computer science, statistics, or mathematics, and is expected to have a strong background and interest in data analysis methods in neuroscience, including such approaches as signal processing, linear algebra, and dynamical systems.

<p>We are located at the University of Washington, and have close collaborations with the Computational Neuroscience Center, the Swartz Center for Theoretical Neuroscience, the UW Institute for Neuroengineering, and the Allen Institute for Brain Science, which together create a lively community of computationally-minded neuroscientists on and near campus.

<p>The Steinmetz Lab is committed to making neuroscience a more open and inclusive field, so we strongly encourage applications from individuals with non-traditional backgrounds or from underrepresented groups. See our statement on diversity in science <a href="/dei/">here</a>.
