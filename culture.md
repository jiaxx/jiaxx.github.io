<h2>Our lab culture!</h2>

We aim to build a prefessional, inclusive and friendly workplace.

<p><h3>A place where everyone can enjoy making discoveries and solving mysteries about the brain.</h3>
	
<p><h3>A safe and tolerant environment for open discussion and diverse opinions.</h3>

<p><h3>We help each other and work as a team.</h3>
	
<p><h3>People joining the lab are expected to respect each other, embrace our lab culture and protect the harmony of our working environment.</h3>
	
<p><h3>Notice: we will continually revise our lab culture based on shared interests.</h3>
