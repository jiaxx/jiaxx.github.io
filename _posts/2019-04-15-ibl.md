At the annual meeting in Paris, Nick was elected to join the General Assembly of the <a href="https://www.internationalbrainlab.com/">International Brain Laboratory</a>, becoming its 22nd member. Nick will serve on the Physiology Working Group, helping to guide IBL's ambitious effort to produce a map of decision-making correlates across the mouse brain at cellular resolution. It is an honor and a tremendously exciting opportunity for the lab to join one of the most fascinating new large-scale team-science projects.
